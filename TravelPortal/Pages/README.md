### DriverInfo

Josh Keller
Designed to incorporate Driver API. Was unable to as "GET" function proved to be difficult to integrate.

Form is on this page to allow a driver to insert themselves into the database. However, due to the lack of an in-class example of a POST API in javascript in addition to failed attempts to scour the internet and ChatGPT for assistance, API was not able to be implemented as intended. To my knowledge, all other functionality needed (SPs, SQL, etc.) is present.

Eventually a second GET API can be incorporated to show Drivers in the database. Can also be used to show a POST that was just made, giving user confirmation their addition went through. 

### Map

Josh Keller
Incorporates POI API in an easy-to-migrate drop-down format. Makes it easier to migrate to an actual map, including external API.

Intended to eventaully evolve into an interactable map, like Google Maps or MapQuest. **POI API** is an example of something that can be used alongside the map to add unique functionality. POI is currently in a drop-down format, which while not as streamlined as we eventually intend it to be, is still relatively user-friendly. API is fully usable to my knowledge.

In its current form POI API can be easily changed to be used in different ways.

This page would likely become the "main" part of the app.
